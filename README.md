# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System  with Web Application (Python / Flask / React)

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using **cosine similarity** and **vectorization** techniques. It is designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences or the characteristics of a selected movie. 
I've used TF-IDF Vectorization / Cosine Similarity techniques to build the recommendation system web application which is built using Flask and React.
